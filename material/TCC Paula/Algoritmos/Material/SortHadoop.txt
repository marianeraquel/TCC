Sort default do Hadoop é o QuickSort (profuncidade baixa de recursão) 
ou HeapSort (profuncidade alta de recursão)

Q: Somewhat of an odd question, but does anyone know what kind of sort MapReduce uses in the sort 
portion of shuffle/sort? I would think merge or insertion (in keeping with the whole MapReduce paradigm), 
but I'm not sure.

A: It's Quicksort, afterwards the sorted intermediate outputs get merged together. Quicksort checks the 
recursion depth and gives up when it is too deep. If this is the case, Heapsort is used.


Have a look at the Quicksort class:
org.apache.hadoop.util.QuickSort

You can change the algorithm used via the map.sort.class value in the hadoop-default.xml.
